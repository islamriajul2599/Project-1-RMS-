## Introduction

This project implements a basic restaurant management system in C. It allows administrators to manage the menu, track total sales, and customers to place orders and generate bills.

  - Display the current menu.

- **Customer Section:**
  - Place orders.
  - View ordered items.
  - Delete an item from the order.
  - Display the final bill.

## File Structure

- **menu.txt**: Stores the menu items with their details (serial number, name, price).
- **updated rms.c**: Main C source file containing the program logic.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
   - Compile the `updated rms.c` file:
     ```bash
     gcc updated\ rms.c -o restaurant
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled executable:
     ```bash
     ./restaurant
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the admin and customer sections.

3. **Manage Menu:**
   - Use the admin section to add new items, delete existing ones, and view total sales.
